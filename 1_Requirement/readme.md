# Introduction
Electricity Bill system is specially designed for the purpose of calculating total electricity bill consumed.
In this system, user has to enter total units consumed and the total sum amount is displayed. 
The whole project is designed in ‘C’ language and different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project.
It’s easy to operate and understand by users. 
The design is so simple that user won’t find it difficult to use and navigate.

### Research
People who don’t have technical knowledge of calculating electricity bill can use this application to predict electricity bill of upcoming months, however, the defining
features of an electricity bill calculator include: 

* Power rating of all loads
* Total load calculation
* Unit consumed per day
* Units consumed per month

In addition, high-end electricity bill calculators generally include:

* Electricity bill calculation in urban areas
* Electricity bill calculation in rural areas
* Bill calculation based on units consumed


## Defining System:

Design and testing operations of electricity bill calculator using unit testing algorithm.

### SWOT analysis:

* Strengths: Innovative, User-friendly.

* Weakness: Cost of calculator increases as features added in the calculator increase.

* Opportunities: We know that we mostly use pen and paper for calculation. So tech based market always attracts the youth.

* Threats: Slower growth in an innovation always threat for the company in this dynamic world.
